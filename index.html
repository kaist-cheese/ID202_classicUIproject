                <p>Survival Journal of Island</p>
                <p>KANYE WON'T SAVE US.</p>
                <p>2022-2025</p>
                <p><strong>Day 1: Arrival</strong></p>
                <p>I woke up today on this deserted island. I feel lost and scared. It's just me, the thatched roof, and the endless sea (mountains). At 6 AM, I heard the morning song (parachute - John K) that pierced my eardrums, but I must focus on survival. I found a chicken shop near Dukgo. My survival instincts kicked in, and I built a small shelter using branches and leaves.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 30: Routine Established</strong></p>
                <p>A month has passed. I’ve established a daily routine: collecting points in the morning, being late in the afternoon, and sleeping or playing games during self-study time in the evening. I’ve spotted the "Highschool Dropout" ship several times in the distance. I wanted to signal for help, but I know I need to be self-sufficient.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 100: Learning and Adapting</strong></p>
                <p>Two months have gone by. I’m learning a lot about this island. I’ve figured out how to catch fish with simple tools and have been experimenting with various plants for food. I had a Chicken Day, and the warm meal really helps. The sight of that ship haunts me at night.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 200: Reflection</strong></p>
                <p>Nearly seven months have passed. There have been ups and downs. Some days I feel strong and capable, while other days the loneliness is overwhelming. I found a journal in a bag washed ashore, which has become an outlet for my feelings and thoughts. I miss human connection, but I’ve come to cherish my independence.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 365: One Year Mark</strong></p>
                <p>I’ve survived for a year! I’ve emerged from Daechita. The ship appeared again, but this time I feel more resolved. I’ve realized that this isolation has given me a unique perspective on life. I’ve grown stronger emotionally and physically.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 500: The Decision</strong></p>
                <p>A year and a half have passed. I saw the ship again, closer this time. My heart raced, but I felt a strange calm. I’ve built a life here. I want to signal for help, but I want to see this journey through to the end. I’ve found peace in solitude and want to see how far I can go.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 800: Almost Three Years</strong></p>
                <p>As I approach three years, I’m filled with mixed emotions. I’ve grown significantly. I’ve learned how to thrive in this environment. The "Highschool Dropout" has become a symbol of temptation, but I’ve resisted. This island has taught me resilience, and I feel proud of my journey.</p>
                <p><strong>Day 1000: Acceptance</strong></p>
                <p>Today marks three years on Island. I’ve decided to stay here. The challenges have shaped me, and I’ve found purpose in this place. I’ve learned to live with nature, and I feel more alive than ever. I may be alone, but I am not lonely. I am my own person now, a survivor in every sense of the word.</p>
                <p><strong>2025-12-12 Final Entry: Escape</strong></p>
                <p><strong>I will never return to this place.</strong>
